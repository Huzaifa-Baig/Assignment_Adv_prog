  <p style="color:Purple;">The Green Company</p>
        <p> The Green Company has been in existence for over 200 years. In 1720, Charles Edgeworth , a Welsh businessman
                        set up a Grocery store.
                        The next century saw a chain of stores in the major cities of London, Bristol, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
                        In 2003, the Green Company arrived in Ireland and has made a net profit of more than $10 million
                        annually from 2005-2022. To celebrate 20 years of operating in Dublin the Company is offering a free electric car
                        to anyone who guesses the correct number in a competition. Further details on the home page.
